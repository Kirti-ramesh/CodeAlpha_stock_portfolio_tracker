# 📈 Stock Portfolio Tracker

This is a simple and interactive Python project that calculates total investment value based on stocks and quantities entered by the user. It was created as part of my Python Programming Internship at **CodeAlpha**.

## 💡 Features:
- Input stock symbols and quantities manually
- Uses a predefined dictionary for stock prices
- Calculates the value for each stock and the total portfolio
- Validates stock symbols
- Saves the portfolio summary to a `.txt` file

## 🔧 Concepts Used:
- Dictionaries
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Basic arithmetic
- File handling (write to `.txt`)
- String formatting

## 💼 Sample Stocks Included:
AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, META, NFLX, NVDA, IBM, INTC, ADBE, ORCL, UBER, PYPL, DIS

## 🚀 How to Run:
1. Open the file `stock_portfolio.py` in any Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm)
2. Run the program
3. Enter stock symbols and quantities
4. Type `done` when finished
5. View the summary on screen and in the generated `portfolio_summary.txt` file
